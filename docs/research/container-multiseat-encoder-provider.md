# Continuous seat media

The worker has a continuous encoder and a concrete source for its existing
`seatDataPlane`. Two isolated Docker workers have now passed local physical
acceptance through that channel. This document describes the implementation
and that evidence; client network playback remains unvalidated.

## Process and media ownership

Each seat owns one Go encoder supervisor and one native GStreamer helper. The
helper consumes that seat's descriptor-pinned capture socket and private Pulse
sink monitor. Its request includes the allocated render node, encoder session
reservation, audio sink, width, height and refresh rate. It never discovers a
replacement GPU or attaches to the desktop audio server.

The codec contract is H.264 constrained baseline at an 8 Mbps ceiling, with
stereo 48 kHz Opus in five millisecond packets. Software capture and device-free
checks use OpenH264. GPU capture requires a matching hardware encoder: NVENC
for NVIDIA or VA-API for AMD and Intel. Missing hardware support fails readiness;
a GPU seat does not silently fall back to software or another GPU.

The retained DRM descriptor establishes PCI identity. NVIDIA's CUDA device is
matched by PCI domain, bus, device and function, then a per-device GStreamer
factory must report that same CUDA ordinal. Automatic GPU-selection factories
are excluded. VA-API factories must expose a character device with the same
identity as the admitted render node. Selection is checked again on the running
encoder before publishing readiness.

Both hardware paths use CBR, no B frames and one frame of VBV/CPB capacity.
NVIDIA also disables lookahead and selects the ultra-low-latency tune. Its
minimum I/P quantizer is 10: OpenH264 2.6 silently dropped recovery IDRs from
our lower-QP constrained-baseline streams, while FFmpeg decoded every frame.
The floor made the exact-frame-count and concurrent-stop tests pass with
OpenH264. It deliberately trades the lowest quantizer values for compatibility;
it is not a claim of optimal visual quality for every workload. These
settings follow the [NVENC](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/nvcodec/nvh264enc.html)
and [VA-API](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/va/vah264enc.html)
plugin interfaces. They are configuration choices, not measured latency claims.

The allocation admits even SDR dimensions from 16 through 3840 pixels and
refresh rates from 1 through 240 Hz, subject to the selected encoder's actual
caps. A client can select a lower bitrate at startup; the capability ceiling
remains 8 Mbps. HDR, changes to bitrate during a stream, and additional codecs
remain unfinished.

The GPU capture path shares the retained GBM/EGL context and explicit texture
conversion used by the encoded capture probe. Imported GPU memory must pass
texture-target checks before download. All pipelines retire before releasing
the GPU descriptor or EGL objects. Hardware encoding still uses this verified
CPU download and upload path; zero-copy capture is not established.

## Readiness and transport

Capture and audio sockets are opened relative to retained directory descriptors.
The runtime root and Pulse directory must both belong to the worker UID and
have mode 0700; symlinks are refused. Pulse's native socket may have mode 0777
inside those private parents. Capture socket permissions remain private. The
retained socket descriptor cannot be redirected by replacing its pathname.

The helper publishes a contract only after observing a real H.264 IDR/SPS and
a valid encoded Opus packet. The supervisor verifies that contract against the
allocation before signaling readiness. It creates a mode-0600 encoded Unix
socket inside the seat's mode-0700 runtime directory. One consumer is accepted;
there is no reconnect or second reader for the same generation.

The private connection uses a 12-byte `PME1` header with a packet kind and a
bounded big-endian payload length. Contract and frame bodies use the existing
worker media format. Video is bounded to 16 MiB including its prefix; audio is
bounded to 1400 encoded bytes. Raw video never crosses this connection.

The worker pins and authenticates the endpoint, reads its contract, and
announces it on the authenticated controller media channel. It sends the local
Start command only after the controller acknowledges that contract.

Before acknowledgement, the host selects the video budget negotiated by RTSP,
after reservations for audio, recovery packets and transport overhead. The
authenticated control message 30 carries exactly four big-endian bytes in
kbps. Selection is limited to the announced ceiling, once per seat, after
announcement and before acknowledgement. Its response uses media control
acknowledgement 29. Invalid selection or encoder failure retires the seat;
a failure cannot release media at the old rate. An older worker that lacks
this message cannot serve the updated host's streaming path.

The private encoder command 3 carries the same four-byte target. The native
producer moves its pipeline to READY to flush pre-selection buffers, sets
and reads back the encoder rate and buffer properties, then resumes capture.
It confirms with private packet kind 4 only after inspecting fresh H.264 and
Opus samples. The worker waits for that confirmation before acknowledging
selection. Partial controls, confirmation, and provider I/O have bounded
deadlines. The original contract describes a capability ceiling; a lower SPS
level is allowed within that announced baseline capability.

Each stream has monotonic frame indices and the first video frame is an IDR. Capture
timestamps are zero because capture clock provenance is not established;
encode timestamps use the shared kernel's monotonic clock.

IDR requests use an independent control writer while frame reads are blocked.
Reference invalidation requests conservatively force a complete IDR. Malformed
packets, changed contracts, invalid sequence metadata, timeouts and cancellation
retire the connection. Provider teardown stops the producer before closing its
pipes and removes only the endpoint whose inode it still owns.

## Explicit worker activation

The Docker backend has an internal `media_enabled` option, defaulting to false.
Only that option appends the final literal `--media=enabled` worker argument.
Container inventory verifies the executed argument as part of recovery.

The production dependency factory propagates that same option to the controller.
A selected media launch reserves its exact authenticated worker connection.
Missing connections fail selection and leave a sticky media requirement on the
launch, preventing an accidental return to host capture.

The enabled path authenticates the seat's private authority before starting
providers and installs the real process adapters and encoder source. It
currently admits the Gamescope `input-pong-v1` acceptance workload in SDR.
Input and rumble continue through the host's existing generation-bound input
authority; the media plane does not inject input a second time.

This is an explicit worker integration path. The host production controller
still has no activation caller, profile configuration or client launch routing.
Single-device streaming keeps its current behavior. Steam, Heroic and Lutris
launchers still need concrete catalog-backed implementations and acceptance.

## Verification and remaining acceptance

`test-encoder-gpu.c` checks PCI identity mismatches, CUDA ordinals, per-device
factory names, VA device substitutions and symlink refusals without a GPU.
`test-encode-media.py` checks actual software H.264 decoding, bounded Opus
packets, the acknowledgement gate, requested IDRs, malformed controls and
normal termination. The real Go provider test streams two synthetic seats and
proves that stopping one removes its endpoint while the other continues. The
image builder requires this test to pass without skipping in the produced
runtime filesystem. Unit and race checks cover contract validation, endpoint
ownership, cancellation and controller acknowledgement order.

Passing `--render-node=/dev/dri/renderD128` to `test-encode-media.py` explicitly
selects a synthetic hardware-codec check. It encodes generated video and audio,
checks acknowledgement and IDR recovery, and decodes H.264. Add `--two-seats`
to start both sessions together, stop one and require 30 further video frames
and continued audio from its peer. This generated-media test does not capture
a game or establish two-client streaming. Use only the allocated GPU devices
and the exact NVIDIA image matching the host driver, or the matching VA image.

The separate physical encoded-game probe still skips the continuous encoder.
Use `POLARIS_PHYSICAL_LIVE_MEDIA=1` for the actual worker channel, with the
standalone encoded-game/audio flags unset. The harness starts two private games,
claims each launch's authenticated connection, checks IDR recovery and input
isolation, stops one seat, and requires at least 60 further video frames and
continued audio from its peer. Video receipts retain at most 64 MiB per seat and
use the system OpenH264 decoder at stop because the prepared host FFmpeg omits
H.264 decoding. Opus is decoded continuously. Every retained video packet must
produce a decoded frame; missing frames fail the test.

On 2026-09-12 the NVIDIA lane passed with worker source `33d7d062c8e4`:
168/168 and 315/315 H.264 frames decoded at 1920x1080, with 558 and 1052
decoded five-millisecond Opus packets. Both seats serviced an IDR request.
Keyboard, relative and absolute mouse, and controller input remained isolated,
including a further input round after the first seat stopped. The survivor
produced 60 more frames after peer retirement. Both workers, their input
allocations and private authority root retired without forced cleanup. These
are local physical receipts, not client playback or latency measurements.

Retain `--gtest_output=xml:<private receipt path>`: properties contain the
image identity, packet/decoded counts, input/game observations and worker logs.
The harness follows Docker logs at launch and captures both output streams,
since automatic container removal otherwise erases startup failure evidence.

AMD hardware acceptance, longer streaming runs and actual client playback remain.
Host activation and profile routing follow that evidence, with enabling
multiseat and no configured profiles leaving ordinary streaming unchanged.
