# Paired client profile admission

The controller can now reserve a seat from an immutable profile route. The
authenticated launch supplies its retained paired client UUID and an already
validated display mode. The operator catalog supplies the persistent profile,
workload, runtime image family and GPU candidates. A device name, launch preset,
application path or client supplied profile identifier cannot select a route.

This is a controller API. There is no HTTP handler, saved settings format,
pairing migration or production activation callsite for it yet.

## Trusted configuration

`production_controller_options_t::profile_routes` binds each profile key to
zero or more paired client UUIDs and one image-owned workload selector. The
factory resolves the runtime family from the exact entry in
`container.profiles`, requires the workload in `container.workloads`, and derives
GPU preference order from the admitted GPU catalog. Each candidate must already
be compatible with the selected runtime image. This layer does not probe or
rank encoder performance.

Several devices may share one profile. A client may occur in only one route,
and duplicate profile keys or clients are rejected before dependencies are
created. An empty client list leaves an unassigned profile. Routes remain
immutable for the controller epoch; editing assignments during a running seat
is not exposed. No worker receives these routing keys in its resource names.

Routed admission requires authenticated worker media. Metadata-only worker
selection cannot enable this path. Invalid routes, unresolved profiles,
unknown workloads and runtime family mismatches fail before host factories.

## Admission and refusal

`admit_authenticated_profile_launch` reads the paired identity retained in the
pending `launch_session_t`. Existing authentication assigns this identity from
the verified certificate record. Its caller must pass that retained object,
not reconstruct it from HTTP parameters. The API rejects cancelled or invalid
launch generations, view-only launches, input-only attachments, temporary
authorization and missing launch permission for a routed device.

Reservation tries compatible GPUs in catalog order under one registry lock.
Every candidate is validated before trying any reservation. A full GPU may be
skipped, but the search never expands beyond the catalog. Shared profile and
client exclusion apply across all GPUs, including reserved and stopping seats.

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unselected` | No routes, or this paired client has no route; continue ordinary host launch |
| `invalid_launch` | The selected launch lacks valid lifecycle or launch authority |
| `controller_not_ready` | Reconciliation has not completed, or shutdown has begun |
| `admitted` | The caller owns the returned exact reservation |
| `rejected` + `profile_already_active` | Another client already occupies this profile |
| `rejected` + `client_already_active` | This client already occupies a seat |
| `rejected` + `seat_capacity_reached` | Every candidate GPU has its seats occupied |
| `rejected` + `encoder_capacity_reached` | At least one GPU has a free seat, but none can reserve the requested encoder budget |

Invalid display requests and invalid GPU catalogs remain explicit admission
errors. These typed results are ready for an HTTP refusal mapping; no new wire
fields are claimed here.

As soon as a device matches a route, its launch retains the worker connection
requirement. Admission failure cannot silently select shared host capture.
`use_host_launch()` is true only for `unselected`. A later stream start also
rejects a selected launch without its authenticated worker connection.

## Lifecycle and the ordinary path

Admission only reserves. The caller must bind the compositor, prepare input,
start and authenticate the worker, and select the same retained launch through
the existing controller methods. The controller now owns the reservation until
cleanup is proven. A weak reference lets it detect an abandoned launch before
RTSP publication without keeping that launch alive itself.

The controller's existing `reconcile()` poll observes cancellation, abandonment,
identity changes and a setup deadline. The default deadline is 30 seconds from
reservation; the trusted runtime option must be positive and at most five
minutes. The deadline ends only after authenticated worker selection and a
committed RTSP start. Merely changing the launch's setup flag cannot bypass it.
No background timer or production poll installation is added by this API.

Input preparation and worker creation both recheck cancellation. A failed
startup or media selection queues the owned reservation for cleanup. Duplicate
starts and equivalent but separately constructed launch objects cannot cancel
the original owner. Pending cleanup retains the exact epoch, GPU slot and
generation, so it cannot release a replacement seat.

| Lifecycle event | Controller action on reconciliation |
| --- | --- |
| Launch dropped before publication | Release its unused reservation |
| Cancellation, setup timeout or failed startup | Fence the seat's activation, then request worker stop |
| Activation still entering, or stream still bound | Retain worker and input; retry after that seat closes |
| Worker inventory fails or ownership is indeterminate | Keep the reservation and input until absence is authoritative |
| Worker absence proven and input cleanup complete | Retire the profile ownership record and permit reuse |

`stop_seat()` also fences the exact seat before issuing worker commands. It
returns `streams_pending` without waiting when activation or a stream still
owns that seat. Claim accounting uses the complete seat handle, so closing one
seat does not wait for another seat's stream. The existing RTSP cancellation
and selected-stream finish notifications mark the retained launch; container
commands remain with the controller's reconciliation owner.

Callers must keep polling reconciliation, including after explicit stop or
failed launch steps. Profile ownership cleanup does not imply that a live
worker can be removed without the existing authority and input checks.

An enabled production factory with no profiles and no routes returns disabled
before GPU validation or invoking a host dependency. Controllers used by the
explicit physical harness may still use typed seat requests with a profile
catalog and no routes. Routing with no entries, or with an unmapped client,
leaves that launch's media requirement unchanged.

The [saved profile catalog](container-multiseat-profile-storage.md) now provides
private storage provisioning and administrative paired device assignments. Its
controller lease prevents edits until authoritative shutdown completes.

Remaining integration work includes pairing UI assignments, public refusal
fields, installing the controller's HTTP/RTSP
launch and reconciliation loop, concrete launcher adapters, and client playback acceptance.
The single-user path and production activation remain unchanged.

## Verification

Offline tests cover conflicting routes before dependency creation, catalog
resolution, fallback between full GPUs, distinct capacity refusals, concurrent
claims of one profile, reservation release, permission and lifecycle failures,
and a selected busy-profile launch reaching stream startup without invoking
host capture. Lifecycle tests additionally cover abandoned reservations, setup
deadlines, cancellation during input and worker creation, uncertain cleanup,
nonblocking activation fencing, and continued input on another live seat.
These tests do not execute a launcher, container engine or GPU.
