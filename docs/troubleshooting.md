# Troubleshooting

The fastest recovery steps for the public Polaris host flow. Use the web UI's
Troubleshooting screen first when it is still reachable.

If the stream is running but looks slow, unstable, or blurry, start with
[Fix a bad stream with Doctor](doctor.md). Keeping the affected stream open lets Doctor separate
network, host, and client evidence before you change anything.

## Web UI credentials

### Welcome page after an upgrade or reinstall

The Welcome wizard is only for a host that has never had a Polaris web account.
Package upgrades, package removal, and reinstall intentionally leave credentials,
pairing keys, settings, and the library in `~/.config/polaris`.

If Welcome reports an error after an upgrade, open
`https://localhost:47990/#/login` and use the previous credentials. On hosts
whose guide uses the IPv4 loopback explicitly, use
`https://127.0.0.1:47990/#/login`. Do not delete the configuration directory just
to recover web access.

If the old credentials are no longer known, reset them as described below.

Reset the web UI username and password:

```bash
polaris --creds new-username new-password
```

Run this as the same user account that runs Polaris. Do not use `sudo` unless Polaris itself runs
as root, because that can update a different config directory.

Restart Polaris after changing credentials. A running Polaris process keeps the previous credentials
in memory until restart.

For packaged user-service installs:

```bash
systemctl --user restart polaris
```

For foreground sessions, stop Polaris and start it again.

## Service does not start, or the console keeps an old version

`systemctl --user status polaris` reporting `status=203/EXEC`, or a console that still shows the
previous version after a package update, usually means the user service is not running the
packaged binary. The Bazzite DRM/KMS recipe points the service at a copy under `/usr/local`
through a drop-in: delete the copy without the drop-in and the service execs a path that no
longer exists; update the package and the copy silently stays on the old version.

`systemctl --user cat polaris` shows the drop-in and its `ExecStart`. `sudo -H polaris --setup-host`
reports both cases with the fix, the Update Center says "Installed, running a copy" instead of
asking for a restart that would change nothing, and the Doctor's `running_binary` row (also in
the support bundle) names the binary that produced the report.

To run the packaged binary again:

```bash
systemctl --user stop polaris
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/polaris.service.d/10-bazzite-kms.conf
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start polaris
```

To keep the copy, refresh it after every update as the
[Bazzite guide](bazzite.md#optional-drmkms-capture) describes. On rpm-ostree hosts the console
also shows the old version until the new deployment is booted; `rpm-ostree status` marks the
booted one with `●`.

### Restart from the console or the tray

Under `polaris.service`, a restart asked for from the console or the tray exits with status 75
and the unit starts the installed binary again a few seconds later, so a restart after a package
update runs the new version. Started any other way, Polaris re-executes itself in place and keeps
its process id. `systemctl --user stop` and `restart` always win over a pending restart: the
process exits instead of re-executing, so a stop cannot hang until systemd's timeout.

A custom unit with its own `Restart=` can opt into the same behaviour with
`Environment=POLARIS_SERVICE_RESTART=1`; `POLARIS_SERVICE_RESTART=0` keeps the in-place restart
under any unit.

In 1.4.8 a restart request could be lost when the host happened to be running a shell command at
that moment. The console then kept the old settings and the log ended at
"Shutdown requested: restart requested". On such a host, `systemctl --user restart polaris` still
works.

## Web UI does not load

1. Confirm Polaris is running.
2. Check that you are opening `https://localhost:47990` or `https://localhost:<port + 1>` if you changed `port`.
3. Accept the local HTTPS certificate warning in the browser.
4. Check your local firewall rules if the UI is unreachable from another device on the LAN.

## Polaris and Sunshine on the same host

Polaris keeps its config under `~/.config/polaris`, so installing it should not remove or overwrite
an existing Sunshine setup. Do not run both hosts on the default GameStream/Moonlight ports at the
same time unless you intentionally change one host's `port` value.

For a quick Polaris test, stop Sunshine first:

```bash
systemctl --user stop sunshine
systemctl --user enable --now polaris
```

If Sunshine runs as a system service on your distro, use the matching system-service command instead.
To switch back, stop Polaris and start Sunshine again.

## Paired client gets Permission denied (403) when starting a stream

Pairing proves the device's identity, but its saved access preset still controls whether it can
start or control a stream. A device set to **Browse & Watch** can list apps and watch an existing
session, but Desktop and game launch requests correctly return 403.

Open **Devices** in the Polaris web UI, find the paired device, choose **Edit Access**, select
**Game Control**, and save. Retry the launch without pairing again. Game Control includes library,
launch, keyboard, mouse, touch, pen, and controller input, but does not grant clipboard, file-transfer,
or server-command access. Choose **Full Control** only when the device needs those broader operations.

Polaris now uses Game Control for newly paired Nova and Moonlight-compatible devices. Existing paired
devices are never silently upgraded, so a device saved by an older release may still need the one-time
access change above.

## Cursor is missing with DRM/KMS capture

DRM/KMS exposes the desktop framebuffer and the hardware cursor as separate planes. Polaris must
composite that cursor plane into the video stream; otherwise the pointer can remain visible on the
host display while disappearing in Moonlight.

Open **Settings > Input > Pointer and touch** and enable **Show host cursor**. New or unset
configurations enable it by default, while an explicit `mouse_cursor_visible = disabled` remains
unchanged. You can toggle Polaris-controlled cursors for the current runtime with
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N`. If a client draws its own local cursor and you see two pointers, disable the host
cursor. Portal capture may embed the compositor cursor independently of this runtime toggle.

## Headless session does not start cleanly

Confirm these settings first:

```ini
headless_mode = enabled
linux_use_cage_compositor = enabled
linux_prefer_gpu_native_capture = enabled
```

That is the intended Headless Stream path for NVIDIA/NVENC and AMD/Mesa VAAPI hosts that can keep
frames GPU-resident. It avoids touching your normal desktop layout and reduces display mode churn
after a session ends. If the stream is stable but logs report SHM/RAM capture, treat that as a
performance/capability fallback first, not a startup failure. If enabling GPU-native capture blocks
launch on a specific driver/compositor stack, temporarily set it to `disabled` and include the
capture decision fields in the bug report.

The built-in Desktop entry streams your existing KDE, GNOME, or wlroots desktop even when the host
default is a private stream, because it has **Mirror the host desktop** turned on in the
[app editor](apps.md#runtime-behavior). An entry with no command and that setting off opens this private
compositor instead. If such an entry connects but shows an empty or black desktop while app entries
work, the headless runtime is alive and nothing visible has been launched in it yet; right-click the
empty screen to open the session menu.

Unsure which mode you should be running in the first place? Start with
[Launch modes and capture paths](launch-modes.md).

### NVIDIA true-headless first launch fails with 503

On NVIDIA/NVENC hosts running true-headless labwc with GPU-native capture disabled, the very first
launch can fail with a 503 encoder-initialization error even though NVENC is healthy. On headless
paths the encoder probe is deferred and served from an on-disk cache; when that cache is cold or
missing, priming it can fail and the launch is refused. The host configuration warnings surface this
as `nvidia_headless_gpu_native_disabled`.

The fix matches the warning's own advice: set `linux_prefer_gpu_native_capture = enabled` (or pick
the **Private Stream (GPU-native)** card in the web UI), restart Polaris, and retry, before chasing
CUDA or NVENC driver issues.

## Fullscreen Proton or Wine game renders on the physical monitor

The stream connects, audio and input reach the private session correctly, and the client shows an
empty compositor while the game appears on your real desktop instead.

If the app is launched through Flatpak, this is the Flatpak portal replacing `DISPLAY`. Polaris
exports the private session's display to the command it launches, but when that command spawns back
out through the portal (`org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`), the portal builds the new sandbox from
the *portal service's own* environment. The portal service is D-Bus activated and holds the display
your desktop session had at login, so it overwrites `DISPLAY` and binds only that one X socket into
the container. Wine and Proton use the X11 driver by default, follow the substituted `DISPLAY`, and
land on the host desktop.

Nothing set at any layer above the portal survives this. Passing the variable explicitly does not
help either, because the portal applies its own X11 arguments after the caller's environment.

Confirm it in one command while the game is running, using the game's own mount namespace:

```bash
GAME=<game-pid>
sudo ls -la /proc/$GAME/root/tmp/.X11-unix/
sudo tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$GAME/environ | grep -E '^(DISPLAY|WAYLAND_DISPLAY)='
```

If the only socket present is the one for your desktop session rather than the private session's,
the container never had a path to the private display.

**Workaround:** launch through a native, non-Flatpak build of your launcher (umu-launcher, Lutris,
Heroic, Steam). The Steam Runtime container itself honors `DISPLAY` correctly, so removing the
portal hop is enough. A direct `flatpak run` also passes the display through correctly; it is
specifically the portal spawn underneath a Flatpak launcher that does not.

Two things commonly trip up the switch from a launcher's Flatpak build to its native one:

- **Re-add the game rather than reusing its old ID.** Heroic gives sideload entries a new
  `app_name` per install, so an identifier copied from the Flatpak install will not resolve in the
  native one. Read the current value out of `~/.config/heroic/sideload_apps/library.json`, or your
  launcher's equivalent.
- **Let the launcher finish starting before handing it a launch URL.** Native Heroic given a
  `heroic://launch?...` URL on a cold start throws
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getGame')` rather than queuing the request. Start
  the launcher on its own first and send the launch as a separate command.

A working app entry on the reporting host ended up as:

```
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 DISPLAY=:2 heroic --no-gui "heroic://launch?appName=<id>&runner=sideload"
```

Polaris exports both of those variables into the private session already, so setting them by hand
is redundant rather than required. They are shown here because that is the entry that was verified.

Polaris logs a warning at launch when an app command can reach the portal. If the private compositor
does not expose a managed window within the observation period, Polaris reports that it could not
confirm attachment. Check the client image before applying the portal workaround: some fullscreen or
XWayland surfaces can be visible even when the compositor's managed-window detector cannot enumerate
them, while a genuinely empty client image still points to the host-desktop escape described above.

## Steam Big Picture black screen or tiny window

Clear Steam's HTML cache:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/Steam/config/htmlcache/
```

If you are using MangoHud, disable it for Steam Big Picture and Steam/Proton launches first.
Those paths are the most sensitive to early helper-process crashes.

## Input does not work

The udev rules and modules-load configuration ship as package files, so virtual input works after
the next reboot with nothing else to run. To use it without rebooting first, load the modules once:

```bash
sudo modprobe uinput uhid
```

If the problem persists, ensure your user has access to the input stack expected by your distro
setup:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"
```

Then sign out and back in.

On an ostree host — Bazzite, Bluefin, Silverblue and relatives — that command does nothing
useful: the `input` group lives in `/usr/lib/group` rather than `/etc/group`, so `usermod`
finds no group to add anyone to. Universal Blue images ship a recipe that copies the
definition across first:

```bash
ujust add-user-to-input-group
```

Polaris detects this and prints whichever command applies to your host.

If Polaris was installed before the rules became package files, an older copy may still sit in
`/etc/udev/rules.d/60-polaris.rules`. `/etc` overrides the packaged file, so that copy keeps
shadowing later fixes — including the seat isolation rules, which then never apply no matter what
the configuration says.

```bash
sudo -H polaris --setup-host
```

Host setup removes that copy only when its contents still match the file this Polaris ships. An
older version's copy does not match — that is what upgrading changed — so it is **kept**, with a
warning naming the file, because nothing can tell it apart from a copy you edited yourself. Upgrading
is therefore the case most likely to leave a shadowing file behind.

If you did not edit it, remove it and reload:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/60-polaris.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Then confirm the packaged rules are the ones in effect:

```bash
grep -c seat-isolated /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-polaris.rules
```

## Client input also types into the host desktop

A private stream session and the desktop session logged in at the machine both see the virtual
keyboard and mouse Polaris creates, so a client's typing reaches both. Enable
`client_keyboard_mouse_seat_isolation` to assign those devices to a dedicated seat, or ignore them
by name in your desktop compositor. See
[host and private session input isolation](configuration.md#linux-host-and-private-session-input-isolation).

## Local desktop audio is captured during a headless stream

In headless `labwc` sessions, Polaris routes launched apps to the Polaris virtual sink and captures
that sink directly instead of changing the user's global default audio output. The healthy log path
looks like:

```text
Linux audio isolation: routing launched apps to virtual sink [sink-sunshine-stereo] without changing the user's default sink
Linux audio isolation: capturing virtual sink without changing the user's default sink
```

If local Plasma/GNOME audio is still mixed into the stream, include the audio section of the logs
and whether the client requested host audio. Host-audio mode intentionally captures the host sink,
so same-user local apps can still be part of that stream.

## Thread priority warning during a stream

If the log shows this warning during an otherwise working stream:

```text
Thread priority elevation unavailable; continuing with the default scheduler
```

Polaris is running, but the user service cannot raise capture, encode, or audio worker priority.
Packaged installs include `LimitRTPRIO=95` and `LimitNICE=-10` in `polaris.service`; reload the user
manager and restart Polaris after updating the package:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart polaris
```

If the warning remains, the user manager inherited stricter limits from the login session. Confirm
the active unit with:

```bash
systemctl --user cat polaris
journalctl --user -u polaris -b --no-pager | grep -E 'Thread priority|RealtimeKit|SCHED_FIFO'
```

Installing and running RealtimeKit can also allow priority elevation without granting broad
capabilities to the Polaris binary.

The Doctor reports this as a host configuration warning too, with the limits that applied, so a
support bundle exported after the stream still has it.

Packaged Linux user units are ordered with `graphical-session.target` and pass through common
desktop environment variables such as `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. In private Headless Stream mode, a missing parent `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
is logged as a limited desktop-preview/portal warning instead of a stream startup failure because
Polaris starts its own `labwc` Wayland socket for the client session.

## KMS capture refused for a missing capability

KMS/DRM capture reads framebuffers straight from the kernel, which needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on the
Polaris binary. That is deliberately opt-in: the package does not grant it, the host setup step
does. Installing or updating the package replaces the binary, and the new one does not carry the
capability, so run the step again after every install or update. With `capture = kms` and no capability, Polaris finds the display, logs
`Failed to gain CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `Couldn't get handle for DRM Framebuffer`, and then either
substitutes another backend or, when nothing else can capture, serves with no capture at all and
H.264 as the only codec. The Doctor reports both cases as `kms_capture_needs_capability`.

```
sudo -H polaris --setup-host --enable-kms
```

then restart Polaris. KMS capture is the path that carries HDR, so keep it if HDR is the goal.

## NVIDIA KMS capture issues

If KMS capture gives a black screen on NVIDIA, confirm the kernel is using:

```text
nvidia_drm.modeset=1
```

If you do not need DRM/KMS capture, keep using the default compositor and portal paths instead.
A startup warning that says `KMS probe could not access DRM framebuffer handles; continuing with
non-KMS capture backends when available` is informational for portal/compositor users; do not apply
`setcap` unless you intentionally selected KMS capture.

If a manually copied explicit-KMS test binary still logs `Failed to gain CAP_SYS_ADMIN` after
`setcap`, check the mount options for the binary path. File capabilities are ignored on `nosuid`
mounts, so `/tmp` builds can be misleading; copy the test binary to a normal path such as
`/usr/local/bin` before applying `setcap`.

For low-FPS NVIDIA headless reports, check `Build features: cuda=...` first. If the log says
`cuda=disabled` and later shows `Attempting to use NVENC without CUDA support. Reverting back to
GPU -> RAM -> GPU`, the stream is taking an extra CPU copy/upload path. Use a CUDA-enabled package
or rebuild with `-DPOLARIS_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` before comparing headless performance against Sunshine.
The host Doctor reports the same fact before any stream as `capture_copies_through_system_memory`
with cause `build_without_cuda`; see [Capture is on the CPU](#capture-is-on-the-cpu).

The expected fast-path markers for NVIDIA true-headless testing look like this:

```text
Build features: cuda=enabled
labwc: Starting in headless mode
wlr: Using ext-image-copy-capture DMA-BUF for headless labwc
capture_transport=dmabuf frame_residency=gpu
target_device=cuda target_residency=gpu
```

`display_preview: Failed to capture cage screenshot` is the web dashboard preview path, not the
stream capture path. Repeated failures are rate-limited in the log, and the dashboard backs off
preview refreshes after failed captures. If the preview is missing, confirm `grim` is installed with
`command -v grim`.

For what the capture paths mean in plain terms and which mode fits your GPU, see
[Launch modes and capture paths](launch-modes.md). For capture performance, check
`/polaris/v1/session/status`; its `capture` object includes
`path`, `reason`, `reason_message`, `cpu_copy`, `gpu_native`, and nested `decision` fields.
`/polaris/v1/stream-policy` exposes the same data as `capture_path`, `capture_path_reason`,
`capture_path_reason_message`, `capture_cpu_copy`, `capture_gpu_native`, and `capture_decision`.
A reason such as `headless_shm_fallback` means Headless Stream is healthy enough to run but still
using the conservative SHM/system-memory path. `headless_extcopy_dmabuf` is the true-headless
DMA-BUF path, and `gpu_native_requested_shm_fallback` means GPU-native capture was requested but
the Wayland capture path still fell back to SHM. Support bundles include the same normalized
decision data under `capture.decision` and stream stats `capture_decision` so a report captures
the selected path, reason message, transport, residency, runtime backend, effective headless
state, and GPU-native override state.

For LTS distro expectations and package caveats, see the [Linux LTS Headless Fallback Matrix](runtime.md#linux-lts-headless-fallback-matrix). Xvfb or gamescope should be treated as investigation-only unless this supported labwc path cannot cover a confirmed target environment.

## Whole-machine freeze on a hybrid laptop

A freeze that needs the power button is a kernel or GPU driver lockup, not a Polaris crash, and
the journal usually has nothing after it. On a laptop with an integrated GPU and an NVIDIA card
there are three drivers in play during a Mirror Desktop stream: the iGPU reading the screen back
for the compositor's screencast, the NVIDIA card taking the frames for NVENC, and the compositor
serving both. Test in this order, one change at a time, and stream after each:

1. Is the machine dead or only the screen? Toggle Caps Lock, or ping the host from a phone. A
   live host can be reached over SSH during the "freeze" and `journalctl -k -f` names the driver.
2. Keep the web console closed during the test. It used to poll the display list through the
   compositor every three seconds; current releases cache it, older ones do not.
3. Intel iGPU: add `intel_iommu=igfx_off` to the kernel command line and reboot. Comet Lake and
   nearby generations are known to hard-freeze with VT-d active for graphics.
4. Take the NVIDIA card out: `adapter_name = /dev/dri/renderD128` (the compositor's node, the
   Doctor names it) and `encoder = vaapi`. No freeze means the NVIDIA side is the trigger.
5. Keep NVENC but stop the sleep/wake cycle: `options nvidia NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x00`
   in `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-pm.conf`, rebuild the initramfs, reboot.

Unload any other streaming stack's virtual display module first (`lsmod | grep -E 'hermes|vibeshine|evdi'`),
so there is one variable fewer. After the next freeze, before starting Polaris again, keep
`~/.config/polaris/polaris.log.backup`: it is the run that was streaming, and Polaris overwrites it
at the next start.

## Capture is on the CPU

Mission Control reads `SHM` or `system memory`, the Doctor's capture row says `shm_cpu_capture`,
and encode times sit at 4 ms and up where a GPU-native stream would show about 1 ms. The host
Doctor now says this **before** the first stream, as `capture_copies_through_system_memory` with
a `cause`, read from the configuration, the build and the capture backend the host selected at
startup. Each cause has one fix.

| cause | what is happening | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `build_without_cuda` | The binary was built without CUDA, so on NVIDIA every capture path copies each frame through system memory before NVENC. `polaris --version` prints `Build features: cuda=disabled`; each session logs `Attempting to use NVENC without CUDA support. Reverting back to GPU -> RAM -> GPU`. Stream mode and the GPU-native setting cannot change it. | Install a package built with CUDA. The official Fedora, Arch and Ubuntu packages are; a source build needs `-DPOLARIS_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`. Only the NVIDIA driver is needed at run time, not the toolkit. |
| `x11_capture` | The host session is X11 and capture runs through `x11grab`, which is a system-memory path by construction. | Stream from a Wayland session, or use a Private Stream mode, which captures Polaris' own compositor. `capture = nvfbc` keeps X11 capture on the GPU on NVIDIA cards that expose NvFBC. |
| `headless_dmabuf_unavailable` | Private Stream runs the hidden headless compositor, and its last attempt on this host could not hand frames over as DMA-BUF, so capture fell back to SHM. | Pick **Private Stream (GPU-native)** in Play Setup for one launch, or set `linux_prefer_gpu_native_capture = enabled` and restart: Polaris then runs the private compositor windowed, where DMA-BUF capture works. |
| `windowed_dmabuf_unavailable` | The private compositor already runs windowed for GPU capture and the last DMA-BUF probe failed. | This path needs `wlr-export-dmabuf` from labwc and a driver that can import the buffer. Send a support bundle from one stream; it carries the import error. |
| `vaapi_system_memory_by_design` | AMD and Intel: every VA-API capture path takes one copy per frame on purpose, because the DMA-BUF import into the encoder has crashed or stalled on AMD hosts (#367) and stays off until affected hosts prove it safe. Reported as `info`. | Nothing. If throughput falls short at high resolution or refresh, lower resolution, frame rate or bitrate first. `POLARIS_PORTAL_DMABUF=1` opts the portal path into the unvalidated DMA-BUF route with no automatic fallback. |

Mirror Desktop and Host Virtual Display on KDE or GNOME capture through the desktop portal.
With CUDA or Vulkan the portal is asked for DMA-BUF and the compositor decides; KDE handed over
system memory in testing. The forecast says nothing for that case, and the session's
`capture_transport=` log line says which it got.

The forecast is silent until Polaris has evaluated its capture backends at startup, and it can
only tell NVIDIA from AMD once an encoder is chosen: with `encoder` left on auto and a headless
mode, that is the first launch. `linux_gpu_profile.capture_forecast` in the support bundle
carries the backend, the encoder, `build_has_cuda` and the verdict.

## VAAPI or software encode fallback

If Polaris cannot hold the preferred hardware path, open Mission Control or Troubleshooting and
check the active runtime path. Polaris surfaces when capture or encode falls back so you do not
need to guess from a black-box client session.

## Linux HDR or Main10 has wrong colors

If the log says `stream_hdr_enabled=false`, treat that stream as SDR. A client HDR request or
`hdr_mode = 2` can still move the encoder into a 10-bit/P010 path, but it does not make a non-HDR
Linux capture path into a true HDR source. On AMD VAAPI systems, keep `hdr_mode = 0` and disable
client HDR requests until SDR colors are correct, then test HEVC Main 8-bit before testing Main10.

For true HDR, look for all of these lines in the same launch:

```text
HDR metadata: available=true usable=true
Color coding: HDR (Rec. 2020 + SMPTE 2084 PQ)
HDR decision: ... display_hdr=true hdr_metadata_available=true stream_hdr_enabled=true
```

If `stream_hdr_enabled=false`, Polaris is being conservative: the client may have requested HDR or Main10,
but the active Linux display path did not provide enough metadata to advertise a real HDR stream.
If `usable=false`, the display path exposed an HDR metadata blob, but Polaris rejected it because core
static metadata such as display primaries or max display luminance was missing.

## HDR never engages

`stream_hdr_enabled=false` on every launch, whatever you toggle, is five independent gates and
any one of them is enough. Check them in this order; each has a line in
`journalctl --user -u polaris` that names it.

| gate | what the journal says | fix |
|---|---|---|
| capture backend cannot report HDR | `HDR decision: ... display_hdr=false` with `capture = wlr` or unset on a private mode | `capture = kms` |
| stream mode captures Polaris' own compositor | `session_runtime: ... effective_headless=true` | Mirror Desktop, Host Virtual Display, Desktop Takeover or Gamescope |
| binary lacks `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` | `Failed to gain CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `Couldn't get handle for DRM Framebuffer [...]: Probably not permitted` | `sudo -H polaris --setup-host --enable-kms`, restart |
| client forced off on the host | Doctor `hdr_disabled_by_saved_setting`; `client_profiles.json` `hdr: false` or `device_db.json` `hdr_capable: false` | clear both, or let the client's own HDR10 report win (1.4.8) |
| client never asked | `portal HDR force -> 0 from enable_hdr=false`, `client_dynamic_range=0` | turn on Request HDR in the client; in Nova it is off by default |

When all five pass, the session logs `HDR metadata: available=true usable=true`,
`Color coding: HDR (Rec. 2020 + SMPTE 2084 PQ)` and `stream_hdr_enabled=true` after
`Session started for [...]`. The encoder probe logs the same lines earlier even when the session
will not, so read the ones after the session starts.

## A client cannot pick its resolution

A device with a **Display Mode Override** saved on the host gets that mode whatever it asks for,
so choosing 1080p on the client changes nothing. When the override replaced a different request,
the Doctor checklist shows a **Display mode** warning naming the mode the client asked for, and
Session Snapshot's **Display mode** tile shows both. Clear
**Display Mode Override** for that device on the **Devices** page, or set it to the mode you want;
see [Devices](devices.md). A launch that carries the client's own resolved profile, as Nova's
does, keeps the client's mode, so the same device can behave differently in Nova and Moonlight.

## Stutter over Tailscale

Session Snapshot's **Network path** tile says how the client reached this host. The Doctor and
support bundles carry the same thing as `client_network_path`: `lan`, `cgnat` (the shared
`100.64.0.0/10` range, which Tailscale uses on IPv4), `tailscale` (its IPv6 range), `link-local`,
`public` or `loopback`. It stays after the stream ends, so a support bundle exported afterwards
still has it, and it never records the address itself.

A tailnet stream is fine while Tailscale connects the two machines directly. When it cannot, it
relays the traffic through its DERP servers, and the stream stutters and its latency climbs. Run
`tailscale ping` with the host's name on the client: `via DERP` in the answer means the stream is
relayed, an address and port mean it is direct.

## A launch was refused

A client that could not start a stream used to see `error 503` and one generic sentence,
whatever the host knew. The host now sends the reason as the message the client shows, with
the one change that fixes it, and Nova shows both in its launch sheet. The `error_code` names
below are stable, so they can be searched for here and in support threads.

| error_code | what happened on the host | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `encoder_probe_failed` | No video encoder could start; on NVIDIA the message adds the driver detail when the driver is the reason | Check the Doctor's Encoder and Capture rows. Against the private compositor: pick **Private Stream (GPU-native)** or set `linux_prefer_gpu_native_capture = enabled` |
| `no_capture_backend` | No capture backend works in the configured stream mode, so nothing could be probed | Check `capture` against the stream mode; unset lets Polaris pick. The Doctor names the missing protocol |
| `kms_capture_needs_capability` | `capture = kms` without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on the binary | `sudo -H polaris --setup-host --enable-kms`, restart |
| `desktop_capture_not_prepared` | The screen sharing prompt was declined, or desktop capture could not be prepared | Approve the prompt on the host desktop, or use a Private Stream mode |
| `private_runtime_unavailable` | labwc (or gamescope) is not installed for the chosen mode | Install it, or use Mirror Desktop |
| `private_runtime_start_failed`, `private_runtime_socket_missing` | The private compositor did not start, or started without a Wayland socket | The host journal has the compositor's own error; restart Polaris and retry |
| `gamescope_session_failed` | The nested gamescope session did not start, or timed out | Check gamescope on the host; the Doctor has a Gamescope helper report |
| `virtual_display_failed`, `virtual_display_unavailable` | Host Virtual Display could not be created, or no backend exists | The message carries the reason (usually the `evdi` module); Private Stream needs no virtual display |
| `desktop_takeover_failed`, `desktop_takeover_recovery_pending` | Desktop Takeover could not start, or the previous one is still restoring the display | Wait for the host display to return; the Doctor's display warning names the reason |
| `session_stopping`, `session_state_changed`, `launch_cancelled`, `previous_session_cleanup_pending`, `steam_shutdown_pending`, `virtual_display_recovery_pending` | The previous session, Steam, or a display is still being torn down | Wait a few seconds and launch again; restart Polaris if it persists |
| `emulator_not_installed` | A game imported from a ROM folder names an emulator this host does not have, or the emulator file the folder points at is gone | Install the emulator from **ROM folders** under **Import Games** (Flathub emulators have an install button), or put the folder's emulator file back |
| `child_tracking_failed`, `no_active_session` | The app started but could not be tracked, or a resume found nothing to resume | Launch again; send a support bundle if it repeats |

Moonlight clients see the same message in their own error dialog; only the code and action
attributes are Nova's.

## Quick recovery ladder

The Doctor & Support page offers three recovery actions, ordered from least to most disruptive.
Try them in order and stop at the first one that gets the stream back.

1. **Force Close** ends the running app. Use it when a client says an app is already running or a
   game hangs on the host while Polaris itself is fine. Connected clients see the stream end or
   return to the app list, and the app list reloads.
2. **Restart Polaris** restarts the host service. Use it when the host stops answering, pairing
   fails, or capture never starts. Every active stream ends and the web UI reconnects on its own
   once the service is back.
3. **Quit Polaris** stops the service entirely. Use it only when you can start Polaris again another
   way, such as a terminal or the desktop launcher, because the web UI cannot bring it back once it
   has exited.

On Windows the ladder has an optional fourth step, **Reset Persistent Display Device Settings**,
for a host stuck restoring a changed display configuration.

## Built-in self tests

The self tests on the Doctor & Support page answer three player questions without opening the raw
evidence.

- **Network Path Tester** reads the live round trip and packet loss for the current client, checks
  whether the control and stream ports answer, and suggests a bitrate ceiling the measured path can
  carry. Open **Advanced evidence** for the per-check detail and the native probe output.
- **Controller/Input Tester** shows whether the browser or the host sees a controller. **Detect
  controller** samples the browser gamepad API, **Log A press** records a manual button sample, and
  **Test rumble** pulses haptics when the browser exposes them.
- **Post-session Stream Report** summarises the last completed stream: the loudest signal, who owned
  the issue, and the launch profile to try next.

**Copy self-test summary** puts all three results on the clipboard in the same form the support
bundle uses.

## Support bundle and logs

The Troubleshooting screen in the Polaris web UI inspects **this host**. It is the place to go
when something is wrong and you want to know what Polaris thinks happened. The
[Troubleshooting guide](https://papi-ux.com/docs/troubleshooting/) on papi-ux.com explains the
problems themselves and is the place to go when you know what is wrong and want to fix it.

When reporting a bug, open Troubleshooting and use **Report a problem**. It downloads a redacted
support bundle and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue with your host OS, GPU and driver, client, and
runtime already answered. Attach the bundle to that issue.

Nothing is sent anywhere on its own. The bundle lands on your machine and the issue opens as a
draft you complete, so you see exactly what you are sharing before anyone else does.

The bundle carries the current run's log, the two runs before it (`polaris.log.backup` and
`polaris.log.backup.1` next to the log), and the kernel's GPU-related lines for this boot and the
previous one when the journal is readable by your account. A freeze, a reboot and an export used
to cost the run that had been streaming; it is now the second retained run. When the journal is
closed to your account the bundle says so and names the command to run instead.

If you would rather assemble it yourself, the same screen offers the bundle and the issue draft as
separate downloads, and describing the active route, capture backend, encoder, and client device by
hand is still useful.

### What is redacted

Values whose name reads as a credential are replaced before anything leaves the browser: whole
words such as password, token, secret, cookie, auth and credential, run-together forms such as
apikey, and key when something qualifies it, as in api_key. Names that merely contain one of those,
such as keyboard, stay readable so the bundle remains worth reading. The exact rule is stated in
the bundle itself under `redaction_notice`.

Network addresses are replaced too, in the bundle, the pre-filled issue and copied support text.
Each one becomes a label that keeps what kind of address it was, such as `[lan-1]`, `[cgnat-1]`
(the range Tailscale uses on IPv4), `[tailscale-1]`, `[link-local-1]` or `[public-1]`, and the same
address keeps the same label throughout one export. That keeps the part that usually matters, such
as a client that moved from your LAN to a tailnet, without saying which address it had. Loopback,
multicast and example addresses stay as they are.

Redaction is not a promise that a bundle is safe to publish unread. Look at it first.

### Reporting a crash

Polaris records how each run ended, so the first question is already answered for you. Open
Troubleshooting after restarting: if the previous run did not shut down normally, the page says so
at the top, and reports one of

- **crashed**, meaning it died on a named fatal signal, with the captured backtrace,
- **unclean**, meaning it never recorded an exit and left no crash evidence, which usually means
  the OOM killer, a `SIGKILL`, or power loss rather than a fault in Polaris.

That distinction matters and is hard to make by hand, which is why Polaris makes it.

The log of the run that crashed is preserved too. The active log describes the run you are looking
at now, so the interesting one is the retained copy from the previous run, and the support bundle
carries it.

#### Getting a symbolised backtrace

The backtrace Polaris captures comes from a stripped binary, so it names addresses more than
functions. For a symbolised one, the matching debug package and `coredumpctl` still work exactly as
before, because the crash handler re-raises rather than swallowing the signal:

```bash
sudo pacman -S polaris-debug
coredumpctl info polaris
```

Include that verbatim alongside the bundle when a maintainer asks for it.

### When the web UI is unavailable

The host config lives in `~/.config/polaris`, the service logs can be captured from your systemd
user journal, and the run-state and crash evidence sit next to the config as `last_run.json` and
`last_crash.txt`.
