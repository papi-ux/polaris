# Uninstall Polaris, or start over

Two reasons bring people here: you are done with Polaris, or you want a clean slate before
installing it again. The steps are the same. The last one decides which of the two you get.

The package manager removes what the package installed. It does not remove what Polaris created
while running, what host setup wrote outside the package, or what you added yourself. This page
lists all of it, in the order that works.

## Before you start

1. Finish your games and end every stream from the client.
2. If you want a Space's games and saves gone too, remove that Space for good now, while Polaris
   still runs: **Remove Space**, then **Remove for good**, on the Spaces page, as
   [Rename, remove and restore](spaces.md#rename-remove-and-restore) describes. The last Space can
   only be archived there; section 1 below covers removing its home with Docker.
3. Quit Polaris. If it runs as a service:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user disable --now polaris
   ```
   If you start it from the desktop or the tray, quit it from the tray icon.
4. Check that nothing is left running:
   ```bash
   pgrep -a polaris
   ```
   It should print nothing. A second instance you forgot about, for example a validation build,
   counts too.

## 1. The Spaces security setup, which removal now handles

**Since 1.4.13 you do not have to remember this.** Removing the package runs the helper for you,
before the helper itself goes away, and prints what it did. The helper is a package file and nothing
else knows how to remove the policies it installed, so that moment is the only one that works.

Read the removal output. If it says the helper refused, the policies are still installed and the
package is gone, so put it back, run the helper, then remove again:

```bash
sudo -H /usr/bin/polaris-spaces-setup remove
```

It removes only the SELinux policies and the input rule it installed, and it never touches player
homes. If it refuses, [Prepare Spaces security support](spaces.md#prepare-spaces-security-support)
explains each message.

On an older Polaris, or to check before removing, run that command yourself first. Doing it twice is
harmless.

Docker keeps the gaming runtime image and each Space's Steam home after the package is gone.
Polaris deletes a home only when you remove its Space for good. The homes left are Docker volumes
with opaque names, listed by `docker volume ls` next to your other volumes. Leave them if you might
come back; the games and saves live there. Remove one with `docker volume rm` only when you are sure
which Space it belongs to and want its games and saves gone for good. The runtime image is safe to
remove at any time:

```bash
docker image ls 'ghcr.io/papi-ux/polaris-worker-steam'
```

Hosts without Spaces skip this section.

## 2. Turn off boot start, if you enabled it

Also before the package goes, because it needs the binary:

```bash
sudo -H polaris --setup-host --disable-headless-boot
```

If the package is already gone, remove the boot hook by hand instead:

```bash
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants/polaris.service
```

Lingering stays on because other services may rely on it. Turn it off yourself if nothing else
needs your session at boot:

```bash
loginctl disable-linger "$USER"
```

## 3. Remove the package

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf remove polaris
```

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt remove polaris
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -R polaris
```

SteamOS:

```bash
sudo steamos-readonly disable
sudo pacman -Rns polaris
sudo steamos-readonly enable
```

Bazzite:

```bash
sudo rpm-ostree uninstall polaris
```

Then reboot into the new deployment.

The package takes its binaries with it, including `polaris-spaces-setup`, plus the user service
unit, the udev rules and modules-load configuration under `/usr/lib`, the desktop entries, the
polkit policy the Spaces page asks for administrator approval with
(`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/dev.polaris-stream.app.Polaris.policy`) and `/usr/share/polaris`. The `uinput` and `uhid` kernel modules stay loaded until the next reboot,
which is harmless.

If this host captures through DRM/KMS it also has the `polaris-kms` package, which carries the
privileged capture helper. Remove it the same way and in the same command, or it is left depending
on a Polaris that is no longer there. Run `sudo -H polaris --setup-host --disable-kms` first, while
Polaris is still installed: that points the user service back at the packaged binary before the
helper it names goes away, and a service pointed at a binary that no longer exists cannot start at
all (systemd reports `status=203/EXEC`).

## 4. What the package does not take with it

Check each of these. On a host that only ever ran the packaged Polaris, most of them are absent.

- **Rules copied into `/etc`.** Older host setups copied the udev rules and modules-load
  configuration into `/etc`. The package manager does not know about those copies.
  ```bash
  sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/60-polaris.rules /etc/modules-load.d/60-polaris.conf
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
  ```
- **`/usr/share/polaris` still present.** The package manager leaves the folder when something
  else wrote into it, for example web assets deployed from a source build or an `.rpmsave` file.
  Once the package is gone, remove it:
  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /usr/share/polaris
  ```
- **The Spaces security state.** The helper keeps a small record under `/var/lib/polaris`. Remove
  it after step 1:
  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/polaris
  ```
- **Docker group membership.** **Give Polaris access to Docker**, or the same terminal step, added
  the account Polaris runs as to the `docker` group, and the package does not take it back. If that
  account no longer needs Docker without sudo:
  ```bash
  sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" docker
  ```
- **KWin screencast permissions, on KDE hosts.** Polaris registers itself for KWin's screencast
  permission by writing `~/.local/share/applications/dev.polaris-stream.app.Polaris.kwin.<id>.desktop`,
  one per binary path, and never removes them, so they pile up across upgrades. Remove them:
  ```bash
  rm -f ~/.local/share/applications/dev.polaris-stream.app.Polaris.kwin.*.desktop
  ```
- **Installs from source.** If you ever installed a source build, its files live under `/usr/local`
  and no package manager knows them: `/usr/local/bin/polaris*`,
  `/usr/local/share/applications/dev.polaris-stream.app.Polaris*.desktop` (this is what keeps
  "Polaris" in the application launcher after the package is gone), `/usr/local/share/polaris`,
  `/usr/local/lib/systemd/user/polaris.service`, and the icons under
  `/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/polaris.svg` and
  `/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/status/polaris-*.svg`. Because `/usr/local/share` comes
  before `/usr/share` in `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, stale icons there shadow the packaged ones, so the panel
  and the launcher keep showing an old Polaris icon even after a reinstall. Remove all of it, then
  on KDE run `kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental` so the launcher forgets the entry, and restart the
  panel or log out and in:
  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/polaris* /usr/local/share/applications/dev.polaris-stream.app.Polaris*.desktop \
    /usr/local/share/polaris /usr/local/lib/systemd/user/polaris.service \
    /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/polaris.svg \
    /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/status/polaris-*.svg
  kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental
  systemctl --user restart plasma-plasmashell.service
  ```
- **Your own additions.** Unit overrides under `~/.config/systemd/user/`, udev rules you wrote for
  a virtual display, firewall openings for the Polaris ports, or an extra binary you copied into
  `/usr/bin` while testing. Only you know about these; `ls /usr/bin/polaris*` and
  `ls /etc/udev/rules.d/ | grep polaris` find the common ones.
- **Steam Input.** If you applied the Doctor fix that turns off Steam's Xbox configuration
  support, Steam keeps that setting after Polaris is gone. Turn it back on in Steam under
  Settings, Controller, if you want it;
  [Steam Input and virtual controllers](configuration.md#steam-input-and-virtual-controllers)
  explains what it does.
- **An older host's KMS copy.** Polaris releases before 1.4.13 had you copy the binary to
  `/usr/local/bin/polaris-kms` by hand for DRM/KMS capture. `sudo -H polaris --setup-host
  --disable-kms` removes that copy, its unit drop-in and the capability together, before you remove
  the package. The [Bazzite guide](bazzite.md#uninstall) also shows the steps by hand.
- **The `polaris-kms` group.** Removing the package leaves the group behind, with whoever was added
  to it still a member. It grants nothing once the helper is gone, so it is harmless to keep, and
  `sudo groupdel polaris-kms` removes it if you would rather it were not there.

## 5. Your data

Everything Polaris created while running lives in one folder, `~/.config/polaris`:

| Files | What they hold | Keep them if |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polaris.conf` | host settings: capture, modes, HDR, ports | you want the same setup back |
| `polaris_state.json`, `credentials/` | the web UI account and every paired device | you do not want to pair every device again |
| `apps.json`, `library_sources.json` | the library and its ROM folders | you want the library back |
| `device_db.json`, `client_profiles.json` | per-device tuning | you tuned devices by hand |
| `covers/`, `artwork/` | downloaded box art | never needed; they come back |
| `polaris.log*` | logs | you plan to report a problem |

Back the folder up before deciding. It is small:

```bash
tar czf ~/polaris-config-$(date +%F).tgz -C ~ .config/polaris
```

To keep Polaris off the machine for good, or to install it again as if for the first time:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/polaris
```

To install again and keep your account, devices and library, leave the folder alone. The next
install finds it and shows the login page instead of the welcome page.

## 6. Check

```bash
pgrep -a polaris
ls -d /usr/bin/polaris* /usr/share/polaris /etc/udev/rules.d/*polaris* \
  /etc/modules-load.d/*polaris* /var/lib/polaris ~/.config/polaris 2>/dev/null
ls -d /usr/local/bin/polaris* /usr/local/share/applications/dev.polaris* \
  /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/*/*/polaris* ~/.local/share/applications/dev.polaris* 2>/dev/null
systemctl --user status polaris
```

Everything but the last line prints nothing, and the last says the unit could not be found.
Anything that still shows up belongs to one of the sections above.

## 7. Install again

Follow the [quickstart](quickstart.md) or your distribution's page. Two things to know:

- With `~/.config/polaris` gone, the console opens on the welcome page and asks for a new account.
  With the folder kept, it opens on the login page and your devices are still paired.
  [Web UI credentials](troubleshooting.md#web-ui-credentials) covers both.
- DRM/KMS capture needs the `polaris-kms` package installed alongside Polaris, and then one
  command:
  ```bash
  sudo -H polaris --setup-host --enable-kms
  ```
  Log out and back in afterwards the first time, because a session picks up its groups at login.
  After that it stays working: the capability belongs to the package, so an upgrade no longer
  takes it away and there is nothing to re-run.
