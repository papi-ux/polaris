/**
 * @file tests/unit/test_watch_mode.cpp
 * @brief A watcher can learn the stream's mode before it asks, and from fields, not from prose.
 *
 * papi, 2026-09-21: "i would like for the Watch Stream to function properly in general, even if
 * the resolution isnt calibrated". A Retroid at 1920x1080@60 could not watch a Deck at
 * 1280x800@90, because the only place the host said the mode was inside the sentence of the 412
 * it refused the watcher with. The same day a game sat open on the host with nobody streaming it,
 * and every other device offered "Watch Stream" for it, because serverinfo said busy either way.
