/**
 * @file src/platform/linux/spaces_nvidia_libraries.h
 * @brief The NVIDIA userspace a host-driver Space borrows from this machine.
 *
 * A host-driver runtime image carries no driver libraries. Polaris resolves them
 * here, proves each one by its ELF header and its SONAME, and hands the backend an
 * exact list of read-only binds. No driver file is copied, relabelled or executed,
 * and a file that cannot be proven is a Host Setup finding rather than a broken
 * launch. The three vendor descriptions are the exception by necessity: the host's
 * own copies name library paths that do not exist inside a Space, so Polaris writes
 * rewritten copies of its own and labels those for containers to read.
