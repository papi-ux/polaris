/**
 * @file src/platform/linux/spaces_runtime_move.h
 * @brief Moving a Space to the gaming runtime for the NVIDIA driver this PC now runs.
 *
 * The NVIDIA runtime carries the NVIDIA userspace for one driver version, and a
 * Space launches the exact image it was created from. After a driver update the
 * two disagree, NVML and NVENC fail inside the worker, and the Space cannot
 * start. A move points the Space at the runtime for the loaded driver and keeps
 * its home, so the Steam sign-in and the installed games stay.
